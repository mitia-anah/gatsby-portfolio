In order to test my ability of creating a page with HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript, I work on photograph website. This was just an assessment to check my rapidity and my skill on building a website. The main goal of building this site is for me to learn how HTML, CSS work, and how to use them. The assessment helped me a lot as I get more understanding of what they are.

Dealing with CSS style was my most challenge part, as I had to start from scratch without any new CSS framework yet. However it was fun because I had to use everything in separately, that's way I could learn how to use layout position, such as using Flex and grid layout. Well, my HTML document was a bit messy for the start but then it updated on the way. What is more, writing the HTML was also a lot complicated as I had to think what element tag should I use. Because it was an assessment, there were many requirement that I needed to follow, such as indenting the element and avoiding error or token like missing closing tag. What had been a very helpful tool that Used was the HTMLValidator, which helped me to find token in the whole document.

Time was the most challenging part for me. We were ordered to finish the task in five days. I found it very hard as I only had a few months of experience with HTML and CSS. The important thing is that I could learn some interesting thing, like using SASS variable to my code, so that I can make my code more cleaner with classifying every style according to what they do. I didn't really know how it works before but I just used it in order to try new thing. Thanks to google which had made my task easier because I had to search an example of how to use them.
