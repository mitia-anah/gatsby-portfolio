Let's play a game!!

Quiz app is an application that is build with REACT and HTML/CSS.  
The app is mainly about quiz, in other word, there are questions and answers. What will users see in the application for the first look is a start button. By clicking that button will bring the users to the next page in which they can see these followings:

- Questions that will test their mind to acknowledge a capital of a city or a flag belong to a country.
- Four buttons that have different names of countries or cities from which users can choose their answers.

How does it work?
The application has two different pages. The first page is where we can see the questions and answers or the options. The second page will be the a page where user can see their scores. The users cannot go to the second page unless they get a right answer.
For example, if a user click a button from the answers, the color of the button will change into red or green. Red color tells the user that they get the answer wrong but green when they get it right. By the time the button is clicked, the "next button" should always appears. One thing that the users will notice is that if they get the answer wrong, they will go and click the next button to see the score. whenever they got their score they can continue playing the game by clicking the "Try again button" if they still want to.
