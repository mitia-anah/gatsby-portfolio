During my journey on learning vanilla javascript, I built a simple birthday application. This is made to help the user to remember their birth dates and days. User also can see another user's birthdays with their photos, names, and their ages.

This is how the app works:

- first, once the users come to the page, they will see a list of birthdays, that set as a default.
- second, the app has different actions, which can allow them to edit a row or rows, to search names or if they want to find a specific month, and they also can delete a row or rows of seen birthdays. In addition, if they want to include their birthday and some information about them, there is a "add button" which allow them to add their own information.
- And third of all, if the users select a row to edit, they can still choose to not edit it by clicking the cancel button or the closing the page by clicking the cross icon instead.
